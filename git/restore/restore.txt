§ restore

NOTE:
	- cf. man git and note files for the differences between following commands
		° "reset*     (HEAD pointer repositioning, operates at  commit levell)
		° restore     (operates at file/directory level)
		° revert"      

- git-restore (1)
	+ restore working tree files
	+ less versatile than git-reset

- handy for: 
	° reverting changes made to files since last commit
	° restoring files to specific states
	° usually refers to files from:
		> working directory aka.  working tree
		> stagged area aka. index
	° ie. deleting changes before commiting

- file/directory level
	° used primarily to restore files or directories in WORKING directory to previous state
	° can also be used to do so for staging area files 

- history
	° typically does not affect history
	° working directory and stagging area files/directories not commited

- working tree or index
	° restore specified paths in the working tree or index with some contents from a restore source

- --staged  --worktree
	° --staged 
		> restore content in the index
	° --staged --worktree
		> restore both the working tree and the index

- restore source matching
	° if a path is tracked but does not exist in the restore source, it will be removed to match the source

- --staged
	° by default, if --staged is given, the contents are restored from head
	+ otherwise from index

- --source
	° used to restore from a different commit
	° in this case works at commit level (restores to state of specified commit)
