§ DETACHED HEAD

- HEAD
	+ symbolic link to current state of project
	° usually pointer to latest commit of branch currently being worked on
	° reference to "tip" of currently checked out branch

- DETACHED HEAD
	° when HEAD is pointing to a "specific commit" and not to a branch
		> HEAD by-passes branch pointers
	° used for revisiting previous commits (states of repository)
	° when changes are commited
		> they'll not belong to any specific branch
		> they'll just extend from commit that HEAD is pointing to
	° synching with current state
		> requires care
		> eg. merging before moving HEAD to one of branch tips
