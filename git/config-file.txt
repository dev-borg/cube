§ .config

- if not set explicitly with --file, there are four files where git config will search for configuration options:

ny single-valued variable set in this file will be overwritten by whatever is in ~/.gitconfig. It is a good idea not to create this file if 
you sometimes use older versions of Git, as support for this file was added fairly recently.
