§ reset vs. detached HEAD

- detached HEAD
	° moves current HEAD from current state working branch to previous commit
	° does not point to a branch but to a pervious commit
	° allows development/inspection of previous commits (previous states)
	° can stage and commit changes to current state using merge 
		> otherwise changes could be lost

- reset
	° resets project to state of previous commit
	° deletes history from that point forward
	° start fresh from previous point in branches/project history
	° cf. git reflog to review and reccuperate orphaned commits/branches  up to garbase collection period/policy, eg. 30 days
