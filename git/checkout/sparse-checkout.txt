§ git-sparse-checkout


NOTE:
	- great for:
		° focusing only on relevant files  
		° managing team workloads through 
			> focused access
			> efficient memory usage
	- inaccessible files
		° directories not included in list won't be visible

- git-sparse-checkout (1)
	° initialize and modify the sparse-checkout configuration in .git/info/sparse-checkout
	° .git/info/sparse-checkout
		> reduces the checkout to a set of paths given by a list of patterns

- FILE-LEVEL command
	° not commit, tag level command

- repository wide
	° settings apply for all branches in repository
	° setting up for a particular branch requires more configuration?

- partial checkout
	° checkout only a select list of files to repository
	° not all

- configuration setting
	° specifies which directories/files to INCLUDE in working directory, cf. partial checkout
	° file to include which directories/files to concentrate on
	° git-clone
		> init repository
		> list files by either 
			~ modifying LOCAL .git/info/sparse-checkout
			~ git sparse-checkout set <files...>
		> clone origin repository
		> working directory/index access limited to files in sparse-checkout list
		> current state of remote repository totaly:
			~ visible
			~ accessible
		> BUT only those files/directories in sparse-checkout will be included in working directory
			~ ie. modifiable
	° git-fetch
		> will nonetheless fetch all relevant objects
		> current state of remote repository totaly:
			~ visible
			~ accessible
		> BUT only those files/directories in sparse-checkout will be included in working directory
			~ ie. modifiable
		> working directory/index access limited to files in sparse-checkout list
	° git-pull
		> recall: git-pull = git-fetch + git-merge
		> implications of sparse-checkout settings same as for git-fetch
		> working directory/index access limited to files in sparse-checkout list
		
- working directory files
	° if outside of sparse-checkout list cannot be added to project
		> => outside of sparse index cone
	° git add --sparse <files>
		> will override if possible
		> care must be taken as tracked/index status may be unstable

§ setup procedure (example)

- git-sparse-chekcout init
	° needs to be initialized

- .git/info/sparse-checkout
	° file to include which directories/files to concentrate on

- git sparse-checkout init
	° to activate any changes made to:
		> list in .git/info/sparse-checkout
		> using git sparse-checkout set <list...>
