§ git-stash

- git-stash (1)
	° stash the changes in a dirty working directory away

- maybe later?
	° not object specific
	° git repository content specific
	° used to stash aside new files or changes to existing files in made in:
		>  index of given branch 
		>  working directory of given branch 
	° puts them in a state (indexed list) to be used, perhaps, later
	° avoids losing working directory objects if a change of branch without git add necessary
	° stashed content will temporarily disappear from project (files and/or file content)

- -u (untracked files)
	° git stash DOES NOT track untracked files
	° must either:
		> add files to be in tracked state
	        -- or --	
		> git stash -u

- hides changes in modified/created file(s) to be stashed

- git stash list
	° verify that changes have been stashed

- git stash pop
	° unhides changes in modified/created stashed files
	° allows for them to be added/commited to project

- example:
	# stash changes
	git stash file-with-temp-change.txt
	# un-stash changes
	git stash pop
