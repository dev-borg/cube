§ deleteing branches

- git branch -d|-D
	° removes reference to branch from git namespace
	° commits remaiin in repository until git garbage collection removes them
	° commits become dangling commits

- dangling commits
	° those still in git repository but that have been deleted due to parent branch deletion 

- git branch -d <hash code | branch name>
	° -d deletes branch only if it has been fully merged into another branch

- git branch -D <hash code | branch name>
	° -D forced delete of branch regardless of merge status 

- git reflog
	° used to recover deleted branches
	° done so by pointing to deleted commits
