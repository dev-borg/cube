- /sbin/init@u
	° sually not invoked directly by the user
	° installed as the /sbin/init symlink
	° started during early boot

- user@.service-5) service
	° user manager instances are started automatically through user@.service(5) service

- init & telent
	° for compatibility with SysV, if the binary is called as init and is not the first process on the machine (PID is not 1), it will execute telinit and pass all command line arguments unmodified       
	° mostly equivalent when invoked from normal login sessions, cf. telent (8)
