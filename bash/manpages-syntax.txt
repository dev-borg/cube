manpages

- some general rules and convention

- Option Synta 
	° options are typically preceded by a hyphen (-) or double hyphen (--)
	° options may or may not take arguments

- Argument Synta
	° when an option takes an argument, the argument is often separated from the option by a space
	° however, some commands may allow alternative syntax, such as using an equals sign (=) or directly appending the argument to the option without a space

- Brackets and Pipe Symbol 
	° square brackets ([]) are often used to denote optional parts of a command or option
	° pipe symbols (|) are used to indicate that one of multiple options can be chosen

- Capitalizatio 
	° generally, options and arguments are displayed in uppercase letters in man pages, but this is not a strict rule

- Syntax Descriptio
	° the syntax description in man pages aims to provide a concise and understandable representation of the command's usage
	° it may not always represent every possible variation or edge case
